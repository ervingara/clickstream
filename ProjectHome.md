**Start tracking click stream when users' sessions begin (via a Listener).** Track information with each click the user makes (via a Servlet Filter).
**Log the complete click stream to a file or PrintStream when the users' session ends.** Try to discover whether the user is a bot, and filter appropriately (currently 252 bots are detected).
**JSP and/or Servlet front-ends to browse the currently active click streams.**
